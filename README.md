Detailed Steps To Open And Run Files

--- 1) Download the "server_app2.py" and the "client_app2.py" files to the 'Downloads' folder on your computer.
--- 2) Once downloaded, open the terminal app that your computer supports (ex. Terminal for Mac) *you want to open 3 seperate windows of the terminal app*
--- 3) First, you need to open "server_app2.py" because you need to establish the server. To do that, on the first line type in.... cd ~/Downloads ... and press enter
--- On the second line type in ... python3 server_app2.py ... and press enter   *the server should be established and running now*
--- 4) Second, you need to open "client_app2.py" in a new terminal so you can use the functions of the app. To do that, on the first line type in ... cd ~/Downloads ... and press enter
--- On the second line type in ... python3 client_app2.py ... and press enter  *you should be prompted to type in a username and then the app will pop up*
--- 5) Third, in the third terminal window you need to open another interface so that you can test the app and talk back and forth to at least yourself. To do this, on the first line
of the third window type in ... cd ~/Downloads ... and press enter
--- On the second line type in ... python3 client_app2.py ... and press enter *you should again be prompted to type in a username and another app will pop up*

(If done correctly you will have access to communicate back and forth to the users on the server in order to have an open channel of communication. Remember each time you want to "add" someone to the chat, you have to open a new terminal window and follow the steps for "client_app2.py".)
